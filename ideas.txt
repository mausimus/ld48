Journey to the center of the ? - style game

light can get broken

travel through:
* tunnels
* forks in the road
* clearings? underground oases?

(1) we start slow but as we get powerups we get faster and faster

(2) our route is important - ancient symbols on top of tunnels/forks
    which contain hints the player needs to crack; diff every time
    like a puzzle, how to get to the end quicker

arcade elements: avoiding rocks, water puddles
possible some enemies later? animals? cave dwellers?

GOAL: is to get to the exit, what is at the end?

Starting screen: you are exploring an ancient cave system on another planet
and the enterance has just collapsed. The only way is through!
Lead a team of scientists through alien underground tunnels.

---- how do we render?
rotate or not?
first person or third person?

would like the shape of the tunnel to change
and entrances have different shapes
> need animation to be smooth

-=-=-= plan is:
1. prototype graphical engine: draw 

make sure eyes on portraits look left/right
